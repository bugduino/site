    <content type="html">&lt;div class="article"&gt;

  &lt;ul class="media-grid"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;a href="#"&gt;
        &lt;img class="thumbnail" src="/images/blog/wish.png" alt=""&gt;
      &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    You are sitting in front of your TV set, while watching the last fresh action movie. 
    The hero bombs some bad guy, while your iPad is off, near the couch. Suddenly it turns 
    on, and 3 notifications get your attention.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      The &lt;strong&gt;air conditioning system&lt;/strong&gt; from the bedroom says it is scheduled to warm 
      the room in 10 minutes. The movie you are watching on your tv-set would last another hour, 
      so it is asking you "do you want me to be suspended for about 40 minutes more?"
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      The &lt;strong&gt;coffee machine&lt;/strong&gt; sends a message saying "ready to prepare coffee, 
      tomorrow morning at 7.00am. There is just two shots left on".
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      The 5 &lt;strong&gt;sensors around the house&lt;/strong&gt; sent their hourly set of measures: 20 
      degrees, 30% humidity, lights off, noise level outside about normal value.
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    You answer to the air condition system in a few clicks, then you forward the message 
    from coffee machine to your personal office email (remind tomorrow to buy coffee). 
    And keep enjoying the movie. Do you like this story? Do you know it is possible at a very 
    cheap price? Let’s dig more in.
  &lt;/p&gt;  

  &lt;h3&gt;First case: a scary future.&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    Imagine a future where the &lt;a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/internet-of-things/"&gt;
    Connected Home&lt;/a&gt; of our dream rest on "Manufacturer-Oriented" devices. Your devices are 
    someway working smoothly through Internet, each one sending messages you are not allowed to 
    access, owned by a different company (each manufacturer plans, builds and manage a different 
    system, code and instructions set). 
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    Your neighbour has found easily your passwords, because you need to create and use so many 
    of them, so they all look similar. Same password you submit to connect on facebook, and 
    your neighbour’s fake online dating service. And your neighbour hates you, because you earn 
    more than him. He just plays with you, turning on and off the air conditioning during the 
    night, to give you some hard time. And the coffee machine spilled too much coffee out, getting everything dirty.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    When you notice what’s going on, you got fever twice, but finally the new password keeps him 
    out of your house.
  &lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;h3&gt;
    Second case: the house at your service.
  &lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    Imagine a a future where the Internet of Things is built with privacy concerns in mind, 
    only for you. Your devices are working smoothly, through Internet, each one sending a 
    standard message to your account, which you read on mobile, on the tablet, on computer. 
    Anywhere.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    You enjoy your movie. You get comfortable with the all-tech-house system. And you praise 
    those guys who spent their time creating beautiful applications for your china-cheap devices, 
    instead of sitting idle watching their sf-favorite movie (you know, those star trek, matrix, 
    star wars stories).
  &lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;h3&gt;
    How Is It Going To Happen and what You should do.
  &lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    At Lelylan we are studying how to build some application to let all your devices 
    play and talk easily, without the need to spend one cents more! If you want to speed 
    it up, here is what you can do.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Leave a comment, sharing your experience. Do you have already some devices? Are you
      planning to buy some in the next future? Which devices do you want to connect?
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Say aloud your ideas about How You Would Like It, if Tomorrow You Get It. Funny stories 
      required!
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Check with friends how much they’ll envy you, as soon as you get it.
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;


  &lt;h3&gt;
    It’s all about you.
  &lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;More you do, more you get.&lt;/strong&gt; Thanks a lot.
  &lt;/p&gt;

    <published>2012-01-16T23:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2012-01-16T23:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://lelylan.com/blog/simplify/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="article"&gt;

  &lt;ul class="media-grid"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;a href="#"&gt;
        &lt;img class="thumbnail" src="/images/blog/simplify/simplify.png" alt=""&gt;
      &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
    
  &lt;p&gt;
    One reason home automation is not getting off the ground is &lt;strong&gt;complexity&lt;/strong&gt;. 
    I'm sure most of the experts working in the fields deny this, but they are lying :) Why? 
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; 
      We need them to build the connected house.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; 
      If we want to extend the connected house we need to learn a protocol. 
      Trying to understand all of those 0x#09fa! codes will take a loooooong time.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Everyday a new standard pops up, as the solution to all our pains.
      Actually, no de facto standard exists today.
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt; 

  &lt;p&gt;
    The raising question is: &lt;strong&gt;how can we improve this situation?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    The answer is:&lt;strong&gt; simple, using the web.&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt; 

  &lt;p&gt;
    Really. Think at a reason not to do it. It's easy, extensible, interoperable 
    and full of people developing cool ideas every single day on top of it.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    Using a platform based on a set of REST web services enable you to access all 
    home automation resources (devices, locations, people and more). Every device is
    mapped to a unique URI which will provide control over it. When such a connection 
    is done, technological limitations disappear and devices become identifiable only 
    through their functionalities. No more headache, just easy stuff.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul class="media-grid"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;a href="#"&gt;
        &lt;img class="thumbnail" src="/images/blog/simplify/1.png" alt=""&gt;
      &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;a href="#"&gt;
        &lt;img class="thumbnail" src="/images/blog/simplify/2.png" alt=""&gt;
      &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;a href="#"&gt;
        &lt;img class="thumbnail" src="/images/blog/simplify/3.png" alt=""&gt;
      &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;a href="#"&gt;
        &lt;img class="thumbnail" src="/images/blog/simplify/4.png" alt=""&gt;
      &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    As you can see on the sample pics a URI can be used to monitor and control everything. 
    You don't need anything else to build your connected house. In this way everyone working 
    in the web can start working on home automation creating &lt;a href="/collaborations/"&gt;
    new cool solutions&lt;/a&gt;.
  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">Home automation: experts' point of view</title>
    <published>2011-12-12T23:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2011-12-12T23:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://lelylan.com/blog/experts/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="article"&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Our last &lt;a href="/blog/sucks"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; explained why home automation isn't working today,
    at least for us. The article was deliberately provoking, and we received lots of feedback. 
    Some were good, some were not, but all of them taught us something. 
    In this article we decided to sum up some of the most interesting thoughts, to remember
    how some experts are approaching home automation.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h4&gt;Group #1. Home automation is my precious.&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;div class="row"&gt;
      &lt;div class="span6"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          I Don't think Automation Sucks. &lt;/br&gt;
          I think Automation is exactly where it should be. &lt;/br&gt;
          Otherwise the costs would drop, the profits would &lt;/br&gt;
          follow and the work load would increase...
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;small&gt;Mr. Gollum&lt;/small&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="span3"&gt;
        &lt;ul class="media-grid"&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;a href="#"&gt;
              &lt;img class="thumbnail" src="/images/blog/experts/1.png" alt=""&gt;
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    For some experts the main goal is profit. They do not care about user experience, 
    services or innovation. They only care about themselves. Their perfect world is 
    the one where everything is closed and under their control, so they can become rich.
    They are the winners, absolutely. 
  &lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;h4&gt;Group #2. Homeowners are a nightmare.&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;div class="row"&gt;
      &lt;div class="span6"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          As long as you are dealing with "A Home Owner" you get comments such as; 
          "it's too big", it's too small", it's too fat", it's too thin", "it 
          looks funny", "I can't read the text", "isn't there a different 
          color", "why doesn't it do everything"...
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;small&gt;Mr. Nightmare&lt;/small&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="span3"&gt;
        &lt;ul class="media-grid"&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;a href="#"&gt;
              &lt;img class="thumbnail" src="/images/blog/experts/2.png" alt=""&gt;
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    I think this problem arise when you lack two basic things. 
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;Know what you do&lt;/strong&gt;. Know your 
        sector and the solutions you can offer. If you don't, clients will start
        asking for any possible idea they have in mind. 
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;strong&gt;Start saying no&lt;/strong&gt;. The secret of getting half a product instead 
        of a half-ass product is &lt;a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch05_Start_With_No.php"&gt;
        saying no&lt;/a&gt;. If people complain when you don't adopt 
        their ideas, remind them why they liked the home automation system you 
        proposed in the first place. I know this is not easy, but it will pay back.
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;


  
  &lt;h4&gt;Group #3. You can not play with me, you are not smart.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;div class="row"&gt;
      &lt;div class="span6"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          Home automation needs a lot of time, effort and knowledge 
          and it's a challenge where you can't succed if you don't have 
          the technical knowledge, pragmatic sensibility to deal 
          with end-users and a strong project management skills...
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;small&gt;Mr. Smart&lt;/small&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="span3"&gt;
        &lt;ul class="media-grid"&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;a href="#"&gt;
              &lt;img class="thumbnail" src="/images/blog/experts/3.png" alt=""&gt;
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    I didn't know home automation was like getting a degree in astrophysics. For sure
    home automation is not like playing with Lego (not yet) but if we keep making home
    automation something so difficult to use, we will never see a connected house in our lives. 
    Wouldn't be better if every single person who has a specific knowledge could improve 
    domotics? We &lt;a href="/collaborations/"&gt;think so&lt;/a&gt;.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    Of course, there were other answers making up other groups, even interesting 
    ones. However, these were the ones that made us think the most. It seems that 
    most experts in the field of home automation have a limited way of thinking, 
    referring only to the existing market. Our dream, the birth of an open home 
    automation system for everyone, appears to be far this way, and
    this is the reason we are here, a passionate need to change the rules.
  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title type="html">Why home automation sucks</title>
    <published>2011-11-17T23:00:00Z</published>
    <updated>2011-11-17T23:00:00Z</updated>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://lelylan.com/blog/sucks/"/>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="article"&gt;

  &lt;ul class="media-grid"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;a href="/collaborations/"&gt;
        &lt;img class="thumbnail" src="/images/blog/sucks.png" alt=""&gt;
      &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    When we talk about Lelylan, most of the people just tell us that domotics 
    already exists.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    As we try to enjoy our time around, we reply with a simple question: &lt;strong&gt;how many 
    of you have a domotics system, today&lt;/strong&gt;? The answer is always the same, nobody. 
    To highlight this, it was fun when during a presentation in front of almost 
    100 people just one hand raised up, clarifying that his domotics system didn't 
    really work.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    It's true, lots of companies have been working on home automation for many 
    years. Some of them are well-known names like
    &lt;a href="http://www.crestron.com/"&gt;Creston&lt;/a&gt;, 
    &lt;a href="http://control4.com"&gt;Control4&lt;/a&gt; and
    &lt;a href="http://www.amx.com"&gt;AMX&lt;/a&gt;, 
    but there is no real market. As there are so few domotics houses, this field looks like
    a dream for many of us. At this point, the correct question is: 
    &lt;strong&gt;why home automation sucks so much nowadays!?&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    People tend to think that the cause for the low domotics penetration is 
    price. This is both true and false. Actual domotics systems 
    are quite expensive, but like all technologies, when they start to spread,
    costs start to get lower and lower. So why, why home automation is not a reality?
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;The real problem are the existing domotics companies&lt;/strong&gt;. 
    They create devices that are not able to speak to each other, trying in this way 
    to keep their market share.  
    The consequences are the impossibility for devices such as lights, appliances, 
    security and alarm systems, gas and smoke sensors, multimedia systems, heating 
    systems to communicate with each other, higher complexities, fewer services, 
    higher prices and more importantly lot of confusion for the final user.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    Thinking at home automation as companies do today, will not last long. 
    &lt;a href="http://www.lelylan.com/blog/why"&gt;Lelylan&lt;/a&gt; and 
    new Internet of Things related &lt;a href="http://postscapes.com/companies"&gt;Companies&lt;/a&gt;
    will change the way we think at home automation.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Let everyone experiment new services, remove complexities, make devices 
      communicate and teach people what home automation really means.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;small&gt;Mr. Lelylan&lt;/small&gt;

    If you think home automation sucks, &lt;a href="/collaborations/"&gt;join us now&lt;/a&gt;. 
    We envision a future where our houses will be the ones we have dreamed when we where 
    child. Don't you love this?

    The Internet of Things is a concept, a cool one I would say. The problem is that people 
    love to complicate things. Thus, there are 
    &lt;a href="http://postscapes.com/internet-of-things-definition"&gt;different definitions&lt;/a&gt; 
    describing this concept. Conclusion? Just a "little" confusion, making the Internet of 
    Things a concept trying to describe everything, and consequently resulting in nothing.
    But let's take a step back. What the hell does Internet of Things mean?
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/br&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;A world where physical things are reflected onto the web&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/br&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    This is the final definition we came up with. It apparently does not say too much, right? 
    Well, not really. It completely describes the concept in all its simplicity. So, why this 
    simple concept is so exciting? Because the #IoT power comes out from the combination of the 
    physical objects which can affect the real world, and the web which is the fastest growing 
    technology platform available today. Just two concepts, but two really powerful ones, that 
    combined can definitely change our lives. 
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    Think about the web as it is today. Lot of services, mashups, developers and new ideas popping 
    up every day. Now, apply all of this to the Internet of Things and try to imagine all the 
    possible new solutions. Smart meters, smart cities and smart houses are only some of them.
  &lt;/p&gt;  

  &lt;p&gt;
    Still, I've many doubts. First, I keep reading the word “smart” too many times, and I think 
    there is little smart in the #IoT right now. Second, the #IoT is for sure a nice concept, and 
    I love the idea behind it, but I can't really trust something that can do "everything", just 
    because there is nothing like that. 
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    Our personal opinion is that we don't have to start from the #IoT to make it successful. We 
    must start from some of its real applications, building new services on top of it. The one 
    we bet on is the Connected House, but there are lot more out there. Just find the one you 
    love the most and make the Internet of Things real.
    And for you, what's the #IoT?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
