  &lt;p&gt;
    The Internet of Things is a concept, a cool one I would say. The problem is that people 
    love to complicate things. Thus, there are 
    &lt;a href="http://postscapes.com/internet-of-things-platforms"&gt;different definitions&lt;/a&gt; 
    describing this concept. Conclusion? Just a "little" confusion, making the Internet of 
    Things a concept trying to describe everything, and consequently resulting in nothing.
    But let's take a step back. &lt;strong&gt;What the hell does Internet of Things mean?&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/br&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    A world where physical things are reflected to the web
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/br&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    This is the final definition we came up with. It apparently does not say too much, right? 
    Well, not really. It completely describes the concept in all its simplicity. So, why this 
    simple concept is so exciting? Because the #IoT power comes out from the combination of the 
    physical objects which can affect the real world, and the web which is the fastest growing 
    technology platform available today. Just two concepts, but two really powerful ones, that 
    combined can definitely change our lives. 
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    Think about the web as it is today. Lot of services, mashups, developers and new ideas popping 
    up every day. Now, apply all of this to the Internet of Things and try to imagine all the 
    possible new solutions. Smart meters, smart cities and smart houses are only some of them.
  &lt;/p&gt;  

  &lt;p&gt;
    Still, I've many doubts. First, I keep reading the word “smart” too many times, and I think 
    there is little smart in the #IoT right now. Second, the #IoT is for sure a nice concept, and 
    I love the idea behind it, but I can't really trust something that can do "everything", just 
    because there is nothing like that. 
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    Our personal opinion is that we don't have to start from the #IoT to make it successful. We 
    must start from some of its real applications, building new services on top of it. The one 
    we bet on is the Connected House, but there are lot more out there. Just find the one you 
    love the most and make the Internet of Things real.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;And for you, what's the #IoT?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    If you want to learn more about #IoT you should read

  &lt;p&gt;
    Lelylan is a project called to life by the need of solving technological limitations that 
    home automation (aka domotics) is facing today.
    Nowadays our houses are furnished with numerous devices like appliances, lighting systems, 
    alarms, irrigation systems, smoke and gas detectors, heating, cooling, audio, video systems 
    and much more. There is only a problem, well, a big problem: those devices use different 
    standards and they can't easily communicate with each other.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Lelylan has 3 goals&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Connect your house to the web with a clear and simple set of web services.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Enable all devices to communicate with each other.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Allow everybody to create new services on top of Lelylan, so that we can speed 
          up innovation in this field.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    To make the concept clear, let's think at some of the most important web services available 
    today, like Facebook and Twitter. They offer APIs to access our social graph or our micro 
    blogging data. In the same way, Lelylan wants to define a set of simple, clear and consistent
    APIs to access all resources interacting with your house through the web.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    What we aim to do is to map every device to a unique URI which will provide control over it. 
    When such a connection is done, technological limitations disappear and devices become 
    identifiable only through their functionalities.
  &lt;/p&gt;  

  &lt;p&gt;
    For the first time you have a real chance to change how home automation works. If you are one 
    of those crazy innovators, &lt;a href="/collaborations/"&gt;write us about your ideas&lt;/a&gt;.
  &lt;/p&gt;
