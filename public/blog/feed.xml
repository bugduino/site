    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has
    been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took 
    a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only 
    five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. 
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    It was popularised in the 1970s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum 
    passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including 
    versions of Lorem Ipsum.
  &lt;/p&gt;
