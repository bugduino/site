      Right now we are focused on building a secure, solid and consistent API so that you 
      can build new apps on top of Lelylan. If you have the knowledge to build anything pops
      up in your mind, do it! Your solution could be the one people can't miss and we would 
      be happy to start a collaboration 'win to win' with you to build something together.

    <p>
      Lelylan access phisical devices through <a href="http://dev.lelylan.com/unite_nodes/">
      Unite Nodes</a>. Even if we have all the information at hand to define Unite Nodes, 
      a strong technological knowledge is needed to cover a specific protocol. For this 
      reason it's important to start collaborations with suppliers to cover the largest 
      number of devices. We also seek manufacturers of appliances, and in general, anyone can
      build devices used into the house.
      The advantages suppliers might have as outcome from these collaborations, are that 
      once their devices are covered, they can offer all services surrounding Lelylan as 
      product to their customers.

    <h2 id="innovators">Hackers and innovators</h2>
    <p>
      Lelylan encourage users who share an affinity towards innovation. People with 
      technological background, a passion for home automation and opensource 
      hardware like Arduino could start hacking and giving feedback. We can build the
      best services only if you tell us what you think about Lelylan.
