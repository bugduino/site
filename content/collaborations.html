    <h2 id="developers">Developers and web designers</h2>
    <p>
      Our main goal right now is to build a rock solid API. In the first period we will focus
      only on the backend and we'll be seeking for collaborations with developers and web
      designer to build creative <a href="/features/#mashups">mashups</a>, intuitive 
      <a href="/features/#mashups">user interfaces</a> and smart <a href="/features/#homeservices">
      services</a> for your house.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have the knowledge and the interest on exploring what can be created with Lelylan
      check out the documentation in the <a href="http://dev.lelylan.com">developer center</a> 
      and start building something new and cool. You could even make some money on it.

    <h2 id="suppliers">Hardware suppliers</h2>
    <p>
      Lelylan develops services that access phisical devices using 
      <a href="http://dev.lelylan.com/unite_nodes/">Unite Nodes</a>. 
      Even if we have all the information at hand to define Unite Nodes, a strong technological 
      knowledge is needed to cover a specific protocol. For this reason <b>it is important to 
      collaborate with suppliers to cover the largest number of devices</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also seek contact with the manufacturers of appliances, and in general, devices used 
      inside the house to introduce a new way of thinking about the ecosystem of interoperable 
      devices.
    </p>
    <p>
      The advantages suppliers might have as the outcome of these collaborations, are that 
      once their devices are covered, they can offer all services surrounding Lelylan as 
      product to their customers. If you feel we can make something together, start learning 
      more about building your first <a href="dev.lelylan.com/unite_nodes/">Unite Node</a>.

    <h2 id="innovators">Hackers and innovators</h2>
    <p>
      Lelylan wants to encourage users who share an affinity towards innovation. People with 
      good technological background, a passion for domotics and open-source hardware (Arduino) 
      could start hacking and provide feedback to make us build a better service. If you are
      one of those check out some <a href="http://dev.lelylan.com/tutorials/">tutorials</a> 
      and get your hands dirty!
