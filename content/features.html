    <h2 id="services">Access your house from the web</h2>
    <p>
      Lelylan is a platform based on a set if <a href="http://dev.lelylan.com">REST web 
      services</a> that enable the access to all home automation resources (devices, 
      locations, people and more). What we aim to do is mapping every device to a unique 
      URI which will provide control over it. When such a connection is done, technological 
      litations disappear and devices become identifiable through their functionalities.

    <h2 id="unitenodes">Every device communicate</h2>
    <p>
      To access all devices in your house we need gateways. We call it Unite Nodes and 
      they allow Lelylan to communicate with a set of devices based on a specific standard
      (e.g Zigbee, Konnex, X10 and Lonworks). When devices are connected through a Unite Node, 
      they are physically accessible from all services built on top of Lelylan and they can 
      communicate to each other without the technological limitations we face today.

    <h2 id="mashups">Let anyone innovate</h2>
    <p>
      Anyone can integrate solutions. Possibilities are almost unlimited and all to discover
      because of the few research that has been done until now on home automation.

      The integrations with Lelylan are endless and they covers lot of fields, like energy saving, 
      security and user experience. We want to build a smart house, where smart really means smart.
      Here some example of what we can define.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Rule engines</b> - close the cooling system if the window in the same room is opened
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Scenery systems</b> - soft light could be the scenery, turning the intensity 
        of lights down
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Recommendation systems</b> - suggest to use appliances when prices 
        are cheaper
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Scheduling systems</b> open the shutters in the bedroom every working day 
        at 7am.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="innovation">Create a new point of view</h2>
    <p>
      With Lelylan there is a new approach to the market, where we give everybody the ability 
      to create new solutions. With Lelylan you do not start from the physical domotics systems. 
      You start from a fake domotic system that anyone can create and play with and only when you
      feel satisfied you can connect to the physical world.
    </p>
    <p>
      As final result we imagine you going to the IKEA or to the shop close to your house, 
      buying a light or any other device, going back home, plugging it and getting it available 
      on web, trough an URI. <b>We envision a system that everybody can have, something simple to 
      use and fast to install</b>. The device will then be able to talk with the other devices in 
      the house, becoming smarter and following your needs in a better way.
