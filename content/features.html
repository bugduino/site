    <h2 id="services">Web services</h2>
    <p>
      Lelylan is a platform based on a set if <a href="http://dev.lelylan.com">REST web 
      services</a> that allows the access to all home automation resources (devices, 
      locations, people and more). What we aim to do is mapping every device to a unique 
      URI which will provide control over it. When such a connection is done, technological 
      problems disappear and devices become easily identifiable through their functionalities 
      and nothing more. Learn more about <a href="http://dev.lelylan.com">Lelylan API →</a>

    <h2 id="unitenodes">Unite Nodes</h2>
    <p>
      Unite Nodes are gateway that allow Lelylan to communicate with a set of devices based 
      on a specific standard or protocol. When devices are connected through a Unite Node, they 
      are physically accessible from all services built on top of Lelylan and they can 
      communicate to each other without the technological limitations we face today.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make this possible we are working hard, covering standards like Zigbee, Konnex, 
      Lonworks, X10, Z-Wave and lot <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_automation">
      more</a>. We also love to hack and prototype new stuff everyday with solutions like 
      <a href="http://www.arduino.cc">Arduino</a> and 
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SheevaPlug">ShevaPlug</a>.

      The integrations with Lelylan are endless and they covers lot of fields, like energy saving, 
      security and user experience. Here some example of what we can define.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Rule engines</b> - close the cooling system if the window in the same room is opened
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Scenery systems</b> - soft light could be the scenery, turning the intensity 
        of lights down
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Recommendation systems</b> - suggest to use appliances when prices 
        are cheaper
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Scheduling systems</b> open the shutters in the bedroom every working day 
        at 7am.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      With Lelylan there is a new approach to the market, where we give everybody the ability 
      to create new solutions. With Lelylan you do not start from the physical domotics systems. 
      You start from a fake domotic system that anyone can create and play with and only when you
      feel satisfied you can connect to the physical world.
    </p>
    <p>
      As final result we imagine you going to the IKEA or to the shop close to your house, 
      buying a light or any other device, going back home, plugging it and getting it available 
      on web, trough an URI. <b>We envision a system that everybody can use, something simple to 
      use and fast to install</b>. The device will then be able to talk with the other devices in 
      the house, becoming smarter and following your needs in a better way.
