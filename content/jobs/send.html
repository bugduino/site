    <h2>Some things you should know</h2>
    <p>
      In Lelylan we have a team culture. We encourage team members to do research. 
      We have a formal research plan that includes incentive comp for conference 
      presentations and a simple process to make sure team members get bench time 
      and resources to complete research. All Lelylan employees get unlimited free 
      books from Amazon. You see a book you want, you use your Lelylan account, you 
      get the book, its yours, full stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      We work with cutting edge tecnologies like Ruby, NodeJS, Test Driven Development, 
      Heroku, Amazon Webservices, Redis, MongoDB, GIT, Javascript, HTML5, CSS3 and lot more. 
      We do not use them just because they are 'hot' right now, but because they are the 
      perfect tools to make what we need.

    <h2>Our hiring process</h2>

    <p>
      Are you interested in Home automation? You can't waste our time. The first step is 
      to get in touch with us. We're happy to talk about our field and what we do. Some 
      of the best testers we've worked with didn't have a formal background on what we are
      searching for, but they are geek, lovers and passionate. That is waht we ask first.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our hiring/interviewing process goes roughly as follows. This is going to look complicated, 
      but we're trying to overcommunicate. It can be stressful talking to a prospective new team! 
      Here's what you can expect with us.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li><b>Phone call</b> - 
        We'll get on the phone and talk to you about the company and what our work looks like. 
        At the end of this call you should have a good idea of what we do, how our hiring process 
        works, and answers to questions about Lelylan. Most importantly, you'll have a contact at 
        Lelylan to talk with and bounce questions off of through the duration of our process.
      </li>
      <li><b>Passion</b> -
        We innovate home automation. Most software written within the last several years is old style code.
        It's not buzz when we say 'reThink your house'. We truly believe in this and if you don't, you can't 
        join us. As you will not be forced to work in an office, we need to see what you have done. This 
        is possible in different ways: website, linkedin profile, github account and mosto important your
        experience. You do not need to be the best in your field, but we need people that want to become 
        the best.
      </li>
      <li><b>Knowledge screening</b> - 
        We do 1-3 phone screens. You'll talk to a senior Lelylan team member who will ask you 
        about your background and talk you through scenarios and concepts from our day-to-day work. 
        It you are a frontend developer, you'll be talking about user interfaces. If you're a backend 
        developer, you'll be talking about code. If you are a creative thinker, you'll be talking 
        about social media. If you are a device integrator, you'll be talking about home automation 
        standards and gateways. And so on, for every open position.
      </li>
      <li><b>Final meeting</b>
        We've talked. We've done phone screens. We've answered questions. You've done challenges for us. 
        At this point we both have a pretty good idea whether you'll be happy working with us. If that's 
        the case, we'll bring you onsite (when possible) for an in-person interview, which concludes our 
        hiring process.
      </li>
