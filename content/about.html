    <h2>Why Lelylan exists</h2>

    <p>
      Lelylan is a project called to life by the need to solve technological limitations that 
      home automation (aka domotics) faces today. Our houses are furnished by numerous devices 
      like appliances, lighting systems, alarms, irrigation systems, smoke and gas detectors, 
      heating, cooling, audio, video systems and much more.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unluckily, those devices use different standards and they can not communicate with each 
      other (unless they are products of the same company). This results in higher prices, 
      technical limitations, few services and a lot of confusion for the end user.

    <h2>What lelylan does</h2>

    <p>
      Lelylan want to solve these problems through the Web, by creating a platform based on a set
      if REST web services that allows the access to all domotic resources (devices, locations, 
      people and more). What we aim to do is mapping every device to a unique URL which will 
      provide control over it.
      When such a connection is done, technological problems disappear and devices become 
      easily identifiable through their functions and statuses.

    <h2>Advantages</h2>

    <p>
      The nature of being a solution based on the web offers several advantages.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li><b>Mashups</b> - 
        Anyone can build mashups with Twitter, Google Maps, Google Voice, Twillio or the 
        next cool service coming from the web. 
        <a href="/features/#mashups">More →</a> 
      </li>
      <li><b>User Interactions</b> - 
        Anyone can integrate solutions based on web, mobile, voice recognition, eye tracking,
        augmented reality, neural based interfaces, spatial motion interaction and smart surfaces.
        <a href="/features/#ui">More →</a> 
      </li>
      <li><b>Services</b> - 
        It is important to take advantage of the possible communication between devices using 
        rule engines, scenery systems, recommendation systems, scheduling systems and whatever
        makes your house smarter.

      </li>
      <li><b>Devices</b> - 
        Unite Nodes allows Lelylan to communicate with a set of devices based on a specific
        standard or protocol. When devices are connected through Unite Nodes, they can 
        communicate to each other without the technological limitations we face today.
