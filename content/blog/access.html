    When you build a home automation system you need to face different issues like
    security, availability, connectivity and interoperability between the others. In the 
    <a href="/blog/electronics/">previous article</a> we pointed out how great it is to 
    experiment with and hack devices with cheap solutions like Arduino, but those solutions 
    are not (yet) powerful enough to feature all we need for the connected house. What if 
    we want to add  SSL, off-line control, protocols interoperation? Actually there we 
    have two possible solutions:
    <strong>single device intelligence</strong> and
    <strong>home automation hubs.</strong>
  </p>

  <br/>
  <h2>Single Device Intelligence</h2>

  <p>
    This is the best solution and it totally changes the way we think at home automation 
    today. Every device comes out with the ability to connect to the web in a secure way.
    The scenario is the one where you go to Ikea or the shop down to your house, buy a
    light, go home, connect it to the web and tell Lelylan it's part of your house.
  </p>

  <p>
    This sounds great right. Yes, it does but it has a couple of drawbacks. The first one is 
    that every device must be equipped with the ability to directly connect to the web (or to 
    the router in your house) providing all security features (SSL and authorization logics).
    This is possible and today we already have the technologies to do this, but it would make 
    any device way more expensive. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Think at a light. Today you pay it $10. What if it suddenly costs you more than $70 just to 
    be connected to the web? No way, at least if we think that home automation is for everybody.
    The good point is that techs are getting cheaper and more powerful day by day and this 
    will let us build smart devices for few more dollars more really soon. Check out

    look like.
  </p>

  <br/>
  <h2>Home Automation Hub</h2>

  <p>
    This is the real solution nowadays. Think at the home automation ecosystem today. We have
    a lot of companies producing any kind of device using different standards. In this way we 
    depend on them and we can't unleash the real power of a home automation system because
    we can't let every device communicate.
  </p>

  <p>
    To solve this problem we need a hub, which is a small computer that will let your house 
    talk to the web, without caring at all about the technology the devices use. In this way you 
    can connect devices that use Zigbee, Konnex, X10 and whatever exists out there and let them be
    accessible to the web. It's not easy, as you need to have a great knowledge of how those 
    protocols work out, but once you do this they are accessible.
  </p>

  <p>
    A home automation hub gives you several advantages. You have only one place to handle
    secure communication and authorization, you can install some extra applications, you can 
    easily handle an off-line situation when internet does not work and much more. 
  </p>

  <br/>
  <h2>Conclusions</h2>

  <p>
    We truly think that making every single device smart is the final goal, but in the meantime 
    we need to face reality and mix these two ideaa which can easily live together.
  </p>

  <p>
    For the braves who wanna start to experiment their first hub, we've listed the 
    <a href="/blog/boards/">best boards</a> existing out there so that you can start hacking 
    your house right now. Just buy one of them and <a href="/about/">tell us</a> what you have 
    done.
