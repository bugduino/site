    When building an home automation system you need to face different questions like
    security, availability, connectivity and interoperability between the others. In the 
    <a href="/blog/electronics/">previous article</a> we pointed out how great is to experiment 
    and hack devices as they are cheap, but those solutions are not (yet) enough powerful to 
    feature all we need for a connected device in the house. What if we want to add  SSL, 
    off-line control, protocols interoperation? We have two solutions: 
    <strong>single device intelligence</strong>
    <strong>and home automation hubs.</strong>
  </p>

  <br/>
  <h2>Single Device Intelligence</h2>

  <p>
    This is the best solution and it totally change the way we think at home automation 
    today. Every device comes out with the ability to connect to the web in a secure way.
    The scenario is the one where you go to Ikea or the shop down to your house, buy a
    light, go home, connect it to the web and tell Lelylan it's part of your house.
  </p>

  <p>
    This sounds great right. Yes, it does but it has a couple of drawback. The first one is 
    that every device must be equipped with the ability to directly connect to the web (or to 
    the router in your house) providing all security features (SSL and authorization logics).
    This is possible and today we already have the technologies to do this, but it would make 
    any device way more expensive. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Think at a light. Today you pay it $10. What if it suddenly costs you more than $70 just to 
    be connected to the web? No way, at least not if we think that home automation is for everybody.
    The good point is that techs are becoming more cheap and more powerful day after day and this 
    will let us build smart devices for few dollars more really soon.
  </p>

  <br/>
  <h2>Home Automation Hub</h2>

  <p>
    This is the real solution nowadays. Think at the home automation ecosystem today. We have
    lot of companies producing any kind of device using different standards. In this way we 
    depend from them and we can't exploit the real power of an home automation system because
    we do not let every device communicate.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    To solve this problem we need an hub, which is a small computer that will let your house 
    talk to the web, without caring at all about the technology devices uses. In this way you 
    can connect devices that use Zigbee, Konnex, X10 and whatever exists out there and let them 
    accessible to the web. Its not easy, as you need to have a great knowledge of how those 
    protocols work out, but once you do it they are accessible.
  </p>

  <p>
    An home automation hub gives you several advantages. You have only one place where to handle
    secure communication and authorization, you can install some extra applications, you can 
    easily handle an off-line situation when internet does not work and much more. 
  </p>

  <br/>
  <h2>Conclusions</h2>

  <p>
    We truly think that making every single device smart is the final goal, but in the meantime 
    we need to face reality and mix these two idea which can easily live together.
  <p>

  </p>
    For the braves who wants to start to experiment their first hub, we've listed the 
    <a href="/blog/boards/">best boards</a> existing out there so that you can start hacking 
    your house right now. Just buy one of them and <a href="/about/">tell us</a> what you have 
    done.
