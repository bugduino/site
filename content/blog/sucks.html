    When talking about Lelylan, most of the people we speak with, tell us that domotics 
    already exists.
  </p>

  <p>
    As we try to enjoy our time around, we answer with a simple question: <strong>how many 
    of you have a domotics system, today</strong>? The answer is always the same, and is a 
    clear no. To higlight this, it was fun when during a presentation in front of almost 
    100 people just one hand raised up, even clarifying that his domotics system didn't 
    really work.

  <p>
    It's true, there are lot of companies working on home automation from many many 
    years. Some of them are well known names like
    <a href="http://www.crestron.com/">Creston</a>, 
    <a href="http://control4.com">Control4</a> and
    <a href="http://www.amx.com">AMX</a>, 
    but there is no real market. As there are so few domotics houses, this field looks like
    a dream for most of us. At this point, the correct question raise up: 
    <strong>why home automation sucks so much nowadays!?</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    People tend to think that the cause for the low domotics penetration stays in the high 
    prices. This is both true and false. Actual domotics systems 
    are quite expensive, but as for all technologies, when they start to spread around,
    costs start to lower down. So why, why home automation is not a reality?
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>The real problem are the existing domotics companies</strong>. 
    They create devices that are not able to speak to each other, trying in this way 
    to keep their market share.  
    The consequences are the impossibility for devices such as lights, appliances, 
    security and alarm systems, gas and smoke sensors, multimedia systems, heating 
    systems to communicate between each other, higher complexities, fewer services, 
    higher prices and most important lot of confusion for the final user.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thinking at home automation as companies do today, will not last long. 
    <a href="http://www.lelylan.com/blog/why">Lelylan</a> and 
    new Internet of Things related <a href="http://postscapes.com/companies">Companies</a>
    will change the way we think at home automation.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Let everyone experiment new services, remove complexities, make devices 
      communicate and teach people what home automation really means.
