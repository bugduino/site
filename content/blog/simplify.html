    One reason home automation is not getting off the ground is <strong>complexity</strong>. 
    I'm sure most of the experts working in the fields deny this, but they are lying :) Why? 
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li> 
      We need them to build the connected house.
    </li>
    <li> 
      If we want to extend the connected house we need to learn a protocol. 
      Trying to understand all of those 0x#09fa! codes will take a loooooong time.
    </li>
    <li>
      Everyday a new standard pops up, as the solution to all our pains.
      Actually, no de facto standard exists today.
    </li>
  </ol> 

  <p>
    The raising question is: <strong>how can we improve this situation?</strong>
    <br/>
    The answer is:<strong> simple, using the web.</strong>
  </p> 

  <p>
    Really. Think at a reason not to do it. It's easy, extensible, interoperable 
    and full of people developing cool ideas every single day on top of it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Using a platform based on a set of REST web services enable you to access all 
    home automation resources (devices, locations, people and more). Every device is
    mapped to a unique URI which will provide control over it. When such a connection 
    is done, technological limitations disappear and devices become identifiable only 
    through their functionalities. No more headache, just easy stuff.

  <ul class="media-grid">
    <li>
      <a href="#">
        <img class="thumbnail" src="/images/blog/simplify/1.png" alt="">
      </a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="#">
        <img class="thumbnail" src="/images/blog/simplify/2.png" alt="">
      </a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="#">
        <img class="thumbnail" src="/images/blog/simplify/3.png" alt="">
      </a>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    As you can see on the sample pics a URI can be used to monitor and control everything. 
    You don't need anything else to build your connected house. In this way everyone working 
    in the web can start working on home automation creating <a href="/collaborations/">
    new cool solutions</a>.
