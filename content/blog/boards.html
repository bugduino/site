  </ul>
  
  <p>
    When building an home automation system you need to face different questions like
    security, availability, connectivity and interoperability between the others. In the 
    <a href="/blog/electronics/">previous article</a> we pointed out how great is to experiment 
    and hack devices as they are cheap, but those solutions are not (yet) enough powerful to 
    feature all we need for a connected device in the house. What if we want to add  SSL, 
    off-line control, protocols interoperation? We have two solutions: 
    <strong>single device intelligence</strong>
    <strong>and home automation hubs.</strong>
  </p>

  <br/>
  <h2>Single Device Intelligence</h2>

  <p>
    This is the best solution and it totally change the way we think at home automation 
    today. Every device comes out with the ability to connect to the web in a secure way.
    The scenario is the one where you go to Ikea or the shop down to your house, buy a
    light, go home, connect it to the web and tell Lelylan it's part of your house.
  </p>

  <p>
    This sounds great right. Yes, it does but it has a couple of drawback. The first one is 
    that every device must be equipped with the ability to directly connect to the web (or to 
    the router in your house) providing all security features (SSL and authorization logics).
    This is possible and today we already have the technologies to do this, but it would make 
    any device way more expensive. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Think at a light. Today you pay it $10. What if it suddenly costs you more than $70 just to 
    be connected to the web? No way, at least not if we think that home automation is for everybody.
    The good point is that techs are becoming more cheap and more powerful day after day and this 
    will let us build smart devices for few dollars more really soon.
  </p>

  <br/>
  <h2>Home Automation Hub</h2>

  <p>
    This is the real solution nowadays. Think at the home automation ecosystem today. We have
    lot of companies producing any kind of device using different standards. In this way we 
    depend from them and we can't exploit the real power of an home automation system because
    we do not let every device communicate.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    To solve this problem we need an hub, which is a small computer that will let your house 
    talk to the web, without caring at all about the technology devices uses. In this way you 
    can connect devices that use Zigbee, Konnex, X10 and whatever exists out there and let them 
    accessible to the web. Its not easy, as you need to have a great knowledge of how those 
    protocols work out, but once you do it they are accessible.
  </p>

  <p>
    An home automation hub gives you several advantages. You have only one place where to handle
    secure communication and authorization, you can install some extra applications, you can 
    easily handle an off-line situation when internet does not work and much more. 
  </p>

  <br/>
  <h2>Board Computers Compared</h2>

  <p>
    We think that making every single device smart is the future path, but in the meantime we
    need to face reality. For made a little research listing the boards out there that could be 
    a reasonable solution to build your next home automation hub.
  </p>

  <h3><a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry PI</a></h3>

  <p>
    This is probably the best solution out there. It's a real computer where you can run 
    Debian Linux at only $25. The initiative, started at Cambridge University got lot of 
    attention from all media around the world and in 4 months they were able to sell over
    500.000 pieces.

    Available for as little as $70, while that's twice the price of a Raspberry Pi computer, 
    the Mele A1000 includes a faster processor, more RAM and a case. It can be a better choice
    if the power given by the Raspberry PI is not enough and you need something aesthetically 
    nice.
