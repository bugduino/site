    Have you ever wanted to make your house accessible from the web? In the
    <a href="/blog/electronics/">previous article</a> we pointed out the existing solutions 
    to hack a devices with boards like Arduino or Nanode. Now it's time to find out more 
    powerful solutions to build an home automation hub which let all of your devices communicate
    with the web in a secure way.
  </p>

  <h3><a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry PI</a></h3>

  <p>
    This is probably the best solution out there. It's a real computer where you can run 
    Debian Linux at only $25. The initiative, started at Cambridge University got lot of 
    attention from all media around the world and in 4 months they were able to sell over
    500.000 pieces.

  <p>
    Available for as little as $70, while that's twice the price of a Raspberry Pi computer, 
    the Mele A1000 includes a faster processor, more RAM and a case. It can be a better choice
    if the power given by the Raspberry PI is not enough and you need something aesthetically 
    nice.
