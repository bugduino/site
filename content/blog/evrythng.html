  </ul>

  <p>
  <a href="http://evrythng.net/">EVRYTHNG</a> is a platform used to create Active Digital 
  Identities. These are unique online profiles for products and other objects to make them 
  part of the Web. In this way every physical thing can be digitally connected.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example you could have a bike that tells you where it is placed if it has been moved, 
    a smart meter that turns on your washing machines at the cheapest times or a camera that 
    suggests you where to go to to get the perfect shots. All of this is based around the 
    Active Digital Identity: the idea of having an online profile for every physical object.
  </p>

  <p>
  EVRYTHNG has a clear target which can be split in three groups.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
    <b>Marketers</b> to create digital experiences and new services built around the 
    relationship between a customer and their product, improving the product experience.
    </li>
    <li>
    <b>Manufacturers</b> to create products with personalized digital experiences already 
    embedded and build applications and services that store data and real-time updates 
    from the physical objects.
    </li>
    <li>
    <b>Developers</b> to create applications that stores and uses real-time information 
    related to the physical objects and to design new way to interact with them.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
  You can start using EVRYTHNG today for free managing up to 1000 Active Digital Identities
  (which are more than enough for different scenarios) and 100MB of storage. Other plans are 
  not available right now and if you have bigger needs, you need to get in touch with the team. 
  </p>

  <p>
  They have a good communication. You can follow them on <a href="https://twitter.com/connectevrythng">
  twitter</a> or on their <a href="http://www.webofthings.org/">blog</a>, which as far as I 
  can remember it is one of the first who started to talk about the Internet of things four 
  years ago. Quite impressive in our opinion.
  </p>


  <h2>EVRYTHNG API</h2>

  <p>
  To make all of this real, EVRYTHNG has created a platform to easily create third party 
  applications and analytics around Active Digital Identities (from now on ADIs), all of 
  this through a RESTful API and a secure software infrastructure that let you easily 
  connect your objects to the web.
  </p>

  <p>
  Going more in details the infrastructure provides services for accessing, creating, 
  storing, manipulating, sharing, or searching the ADIs for millions of real-world objects, 
  and also a set of services and tools that can be useful for such applications. 
  </p>

  <p>
  EVRYTHNG is currently in closed Beta and is available only to a limited group of commercial 
  and academic partners. Anyway, I'm sure that signing up proposing ideas you want to develop 
  will give you an early access. The main concepts are easy to get and the documentation let 
  you understand the service step by step. Here an introduction.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
    <code>Thngs</code> (it is not misspelled, they call it in this way) have various 
    <code>Properties</code> and can be organized into <code>Collections</code>, and 
    operated on by <code>Users</code> and <code>Groups</code>. Access control schemes 
    can be used to decide who can interact with what resource and how. This is all you 
    need to know to have a basic idea. Lets dig in deep.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
  It accept JSON-P callbacks by adding a <code>?callback</code> parameter to any GET call
  so that you can have the results wrapped in a JSON function and they limit requests to API
  to 5000 per day.
  </p>

  <p>
  The services are not complex and they are well described in the web site, so here we just 
  sum them up.
  </p>

  <h3><a href="http://dev.evrythng.net/#thngs">THNGS</a></h3>
  
  <p>
  An abstract notion of an object which has location and property data associated to it. Also 
  called Active Digital Identities (ADIs), these resources can model real-world elements such 
  as persons, places, cars, guitars, mobile phones, etc. 
  </p>

  <p>
  You can set different params like a name, longitude, latitude which can be used to identify 
  the thng, but also to enable search queries later on. Nice the ability to create many things 
  at once which returns a list of IDs for the newly created resources.
  </p>

  <p>
  Sample <code>thng</code> representation.
  </p>

<pre>
{
"id": "44ed3d1ad0b1cdc02490081ca",
"name": "Television",
"description": "Sony Smart Television",
"is_public": false,
"latitude": "43.772828",
"longitude": "11.249488",
"created_at": "2011-04-18T23:23:56Z"
}</pre>

  <h3><a href="http://dev.evrythng.net/#properties">PROPERTIES</a></h3>

  <p>
  A Thng can have properties which are arbitrary key/value pairs to store any data. Values could 
  be either text or binary.
  </p>

  <p>
  Sample <code>property</code> representation.
  </p>

<pre>
{
"key": "Volume",
"value": "20"
"created_at": "2011-04-18T12:10:56Z"
}</pre>


  <h3><a href="http://dev.evrythng.net/#collections">COLLECTIONS</a></h3>

  <p>
  A collection is a group of Thngs. Collections can be created by various users, and the same 
  Thng can be in more than one collection.
  </p>

  <p>
  Sample <code>collection</code> representation.
  </p>

<pre>
{
"id": "44ed3d1ad0b1cdc02490081de",
"name": "Electronics",
"description": "Contains all electronics in my house",
"is_public": true,
"created_at": "2012-07-18T23:23:56Z"
}</pre>

  <h3>Other stuff</h3>

  <p>
  There is also a <a href="http://dev.evrythng.net/#search">search</a> service which does 
  what it says. You can also find some wrappers to easily start building clients in 
  <a href="https://github.com/evrythng/evrythng-java-wrapper">Java</a> and 
  <a href="https://github.com/evrythng/evrythng-ruby-wrapper">Ruby</a>.
  </p>


  <h2>Conclusions</h2>

  <p>
  When you get to read the website you get a nice feeling. Everything is placed in the right 
  place, the design is very nice and the main concepts are easy to grasp.
  </p>

  <p>
  Overall EVRYTHNG is a simple product if compared with solutions like 
  <a href="http://lelylan.com/blog/cosm/">COSM</a>, but its simplicity is 
  also its strength. We really enjoyed walking through the whole documentation 
  and we had the feeling we could have started to use them right now. We loved this.
  </p>

  <p>
  In the other side, the APIs don't let you do that much and this limits the developer 
  ability to build new services. Concepts like oauth2 or physical devices provisioning
  are not faced and in our opinion are too important to be left apart. Once they will be
  integrated (or publicly released) they will be ready for the real Internet of Things market.
