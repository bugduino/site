    You are sitting in front of your TV set, while watching the last fresh action movie. 
    The hero bombs some bad guy, while your iPad is off, near the couch. Suddenly it turns 
    on, and 3 notifications get your attention.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      The <strong>air conditioning system</strong> from the bedroom says it is scheduled to warm 
      the room in 10 minutes. The movie you are watching on your tv-set would last another hour, 
      so it is asking you "do you want me to be suspended for about 40 minutes more?"
    </li>
    <li>
      The <strong>coffee machine</strong> sends a message saying "ready to prepare coffee, 
      tomorrow morning at 7.00am. There is just two shots left on".
    </li>
    <li>
      The 5 <strong>sensors around the house</strong> sent their hourly set of measures: 20 
      degrees, 30% humidity, lights off, noise level outside about normal value.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    You answer to the air condition system in a few clicks, then you forward the message 
    from coffee machine to your personal office email (remind tomorrow to buy coffee). 
    And keep enjoying the movie. Do you like this story? Do you know it is possible at a very 
    cheap price? Let’s dig more in.
  </p>  

  <h3>First case: a scary future.</h3>

  <p>
    Imagine a future where the <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/internet-of-things/">
    Connected Home</a> of our dream rest on "Manufacturer-Oriented" devices. Your devices are 
    someway working smoothly through Internet, each one sending messages you are not allowed to 
    access, owned by a different company (each manufacturer plans, builds and manage a different 
    system, code and instructions set). 
  </p>

  <p>
    Your neighbour has found easily your passwords, because you need to create and use so many 
    of them, so they all look similar. Same password you submit to connect on facebook, and 
    your neighbour’s fake online dating service. And your neighbour hates you, because you earn 
    more than him. He just plays with you, turning on and off the air conditioning during the 
    night, to give you some hard time. And the coffee machine spilled too much coffee out, getting everything dirty.
  </p>

  <p>
    When you notice what’s going on, you got fever twice, but finally the new password keeps him 
    out of your house.
  </p>


  <h3>
    Second case: the house at your service.
  </h3>

  <p>
    Imagine a a future where the Internet of Things is built with privacy concerns in mind, 
    only for you. Your devices are working smoothly, through Internet, each one sending a 
    standard message to your account, which you read on mobile, on the tablet, on computer. 
    Anywhere.
  </p>

  <p>
    You enjoy your movie. You get comfortable with the all-tech-house system. And you praise 
    those guys who spent their time creating beautiful applications for your china-cheap devices, 
    instead of sitting idle watching their sf-favorite movie (you know, those star trek, matrix, 
    star wars stories).
  </p>


  <h3>
    How Is It Going To Happen and what You should do.
  </h3>

  <p>
    At Lelylan we are studying how to build some application to let all your devices 
    play and talk easily, without the need to spend one cents more! If you want to speed 
    it up, here is what you can do.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Leave a comment, sharing your experience. Do you have already some devices? Are you
      planning to buy some in the next future? Which devices do you want to connect?
    </li>
    <li>
      Say aloud your ideas about How You Would Like It, if Tomorrow You Get It. Funny stories 
      required!
    </li>
    <li>
      Check with friends how much they’ll envy you, as soon as you get it.
    </li>
  </ol>


  <h3>
    It’s all about you.
  </h3>

  <p>
  <strong>More you do, more you get.</strong> Thanks a lot.
