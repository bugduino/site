    The Internet of Things is a concept, a cool one I would say. The problem is that people 
    love to complicate things. Thus, there are 
    <a href="http://postscapes.com/internet-of-things-platforms">different definitions</a> 
    describing this concept. Conclusion? Just a "little" confusion, making the Internet of 
    Things a concept trying to describe everything, and consequently resulting in nothing.
    But let's take a step back. <strong>What the hell does Internet of Things mean?</strong>
  </p>

  </br>
  <blockquote>
    A world where physical things are reflected to the web
  </blockquote>
  </br>

  <p>
    This is the final definition we came up with. It apparently does not say too much, right? 
    Well, not really. It completely describes the concept in all its simplicity. So, why this 
    simple concept is so exciting? Because the #IoT power comes out from the combination of the 
    physical objects which can affect the real world, and the web which is the fastest growing 
    technology platform available today. Just two concepts, but two really powerful ones, that 
    combined can definitely change our lives. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Think about the web as it is today. Lot of services, mashups, developers and new ideas popping 
    up every day. Now, apply all of this to the Internet of Things and try to imagine all the 
    possible new solutions. Smart meters, smart cities and smart houses are only some of them.
  </p>  

  <p>
    Still, I've many doubts. First, I keep reading the word “smart” too many times, and I think 
    there is little smart in the #IoT right now. Second, the #IoT is for sure a nice concept, and 
    I love the idea behind it, but I can't really trust something that can do "everything", just 
    because there is nothing like that. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Our personal opinion is that we don't have to start from the #IoT to make it successful. We 
    must start from some of its real applications, building new services on top of it. The one 
    we bet on is the Connected House, but there are lot more out there. Just find the one you 
    love the most and make the Internet of Things real.

  <p>And for you, what's the #IoT?</p>
