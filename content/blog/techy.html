    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has
    been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took 
    a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only 
    five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.

    It was popularised in the 1970s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum 
    passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including 
    versions of Lorem Ipsum.
