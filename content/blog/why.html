    Lelylan is a project called to life by the need to solve technological limitations 
    that home automation (aka domotics) faces today.
    Nowadays our houses are furnished by numerous devices like appliances, lighting systems, 
    alarms, irrigation systems, smoke and gas detectors, heating, cooling, audio, video systems 
    and much more. There is only a problem, well, a big problem: those devices use different 
    standards and they can not communicate with each other (unless they are products of the 
    same company or you have lot of money). 
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Lelylan has 3 goals</strong>
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <ol>
      <li>Connect your house to the web using a clear and simple set of web services.</li>
      <li>Enable all devices to communicate to each other.</li>
      <li>Allow everybody to create new services on top of Lelylan, so that we can speed 
          up innovation in this field.</li>
    <ol>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    To make the concept clear, lets think at some of the most important web services available 
    today, like Facebook and Twitter. They offers APIs to access our social graph or our micro 
    blogging data. In the same way, Lelylan wants to define a set of simple, clear and consistent
    APIs to access, through the web, all resources interacting with your house.
  </p>

  <p>
    What we aim to do is to map every device to a unique URI which will provide control over it. 
    When such a connection is done, technological limitations disappear and devices become 
    identifiable only through their functionalities.
  </p>

    For the first time you have a real chance to change how home automation works. If you are one 
    of those crazy innovators, <a href="/collaborations/">write us about your ideas</a>.
