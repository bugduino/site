    <h2>Lelylan Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy describes Lelylan's policies and procedures on the collection, use 
      and disclosure of your information. Lelylan receives your information through our various 
      web sites, APIs, applications, services and third-parties ("Services"). When using any of 
      our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure 
      and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. Irrespective of 
      which country that you reside in or create information from, your information may be used 
      by Lelylan in the United States or any other country where Lelylan operates.
    </p>

    <h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>
    <p>
      We collect and use your information to provide and measure use of our Services and improve 
      them over time.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Information Collected Upon Registration</b>: When you create or reconfigure a Lelylan 
      account, you provide some personal information, such as your name, username, password, and 
      email address. Some of this information, for example, your name and username, is listed 
      publicly on our Services, including on your profile page and in search results. Some 
      Services, such as search, public user profiles and viewing types, do not require registration.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Additional Information</b>: You may provide us with additional information to make public, 
      such as a short biography, your location, or a picture. We may use your contact 
      information to send you information about our Services or to market to you. You may 
      unsubscribe from these messages by following the instructions contained within the messages 
      or the instructions on our web site. If you email us, we may keep your message, email 
      address and contact information to respond to your request. Providing the additional 
      information described in this section is entirely optional.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Devices, Types, Locations and Users</b>: Our Services are primarily designed to connect 
      your house to the web. We may use your Content to build statistics and improve our services.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Location Information</b>: You may choose to note your location in your Houses and in 
      your Lelylan profile. If you send your location, we may also save exact coordinates to 
      help improve our service.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Log Data</b>: Our servers automatically record information ("Log Data") created by 
      your use of the Services. Log Data may include information such as your IP address, 
      browser type, the referring domain, pages visited, your mobile carrier, device and 
      application IDs, and search terms. Other actions, such as interactions with our website, 
      applications and advertisements, may also be included in Log Data. If we havenâ€™t already 
      deleted the Log Data earlier, we will either delete it or remove any common account 
      identifiers, such as your username, full IP address, or email address, after 18 months.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Links</b>: Lelylan may keep track of how you interact with links across our Services 
      including third party services and clients by redirecting clicks or through other means. 
      We do this to help improve our Services, including advertising, and to be able to share 
      aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <b>Cookies</b>: Like many websites, we use "cookie" technology to collect additional website 
      usage data and to improve our Services, but we do not require cookies for many parts of our 
      Services. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer's hard disk. 
      Lelylan may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you 
      interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing 
      on our Services, and to improve our Services. Most Internet browsers automatically accept 
      cookies. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies 
      or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Third Party Services</b>: Lelylan uses a variety of services hosted by third parties to 
      help provide our Services, such as hosting our various blogs and wikis, and to help us 
      understand the use of our Services, such as Google Analytics. These services may collect 
      information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, such as cookies or your 
      IP request.
    </p>

    <h3>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3>
    <p>
      We do not disclose your private information except in the limited circumstances described 
      here. Your Consent: We may share or disclose your information with your consent, such as 
      when you use a third party web client or application to access your Lelylan account.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Service Providers</b>: We engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions 
      and provide services to us. We may share your personal information with these third 
      parties, but only to the extent necessary to perform these functions and provide such 
      services, and only pursuant to obligations mirroring the protections of this privacy 
      policy.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Law and Harm</b>: We may preserve or disclose your information if we believe that it 
      is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect 
      the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect 
      Lelylan's rights or property.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Business Transfers</b>: In the event that Lelylan is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, 
      acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or 
      transferred as part of that transaction. The promises in this privacy policy will apply 
      to your information as transferred to the new entity.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Non-Private or Non-Personal Information</b>: We may share or disclose your non-private,
      aggregated or otherwise non-personal information.
    </p>

    <h3>Modifying Your Personal Information</h3>
    <p>
      If you are a registered user of our Services, we provide you with tools to access or 
      modify the personal information you provided to us and associated with your account.
    </p>

    <h3>Our Policy Towards Children</h3>
    <p>
      Our Services are not directed to people under 14. If you become aware that your child 
      has provided us with personal information without your consent, please contact us. We 
      do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 14. If we become aware 
      that a child under 14 has provided us with personal information, we take steps to remove 
      such information and terminate the child's account.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Changes to this Policy</h3>
    <p>
      We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of the 
      policy will govern our use of your information and will always be at 
      <a href="/privacy/">lelylan.com/privacy/</a>. If we make a change to this policy 
      that, in our sole discretion, is material, we will notify you via an @lelylan update or 
      e-mail to the email associated with your account. By continuing to access or use the 
      Services after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised 
      Privacy Policy.
